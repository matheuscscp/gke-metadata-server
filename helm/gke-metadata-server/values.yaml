# with the the Google Metadata IP address (169.254.169.254) using the CLI "init-network"
# command (see k8s/test-pod.yaml). This allows your pods to run without the sidecar,
# but also requires the emulator to listen on port 80 (on the host network!). When
# doing so, it's also advisable to set the Helm value config.serverAddr including
# this IP address, i.e. set the server addres to "169.254.169.254:80". This way only
# connections targeting this specific IP address will reach the server.
